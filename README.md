# Horiseon Digital Marketing Home Page

## Description

I wanted to work on this project to learn more about refactoring code. The code needed to be refactored to allow greater access to the site by people using screen-readers and the like. It is my hope that my refactoring has solved the issue of accessibility for this site. I learned more about HTML and CSS code that I know will help me keep reaching my goals throughout the bootcamp and after.
